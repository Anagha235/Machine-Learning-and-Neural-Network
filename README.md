# Project Title: Machine Learning Tutorial on K-means Clustering
Objective: The goal of this tutorial is to illustrate the K-means clustering technique with an emphasis on clustering using Euclidean and Cosine Similarity, two distinct distance metrics. Additionally, it demonstrates how to visualize clusters in a 2D space using PCA's dimensionality reduction approach. The objective is to comprehend how the K-means algorithm functions and how clustering is affected by the distance metric selection.

The repository's structure:

Jupyter Notepad:
Includes all of the procedures needed to apply K-means clustering with both Euclidean and Cosine distance measures.
demonstrates how to visualize clusters in two dimensions using PCA.
Includes silhouette score calculations to assess clustering effectiveness.

Instructional PDF:
A detailed tutorial that explains K-means clustering and how distance measurements affect it.

Instructions:

1.Clone or download this repository.

2.Ensure that the following libraries are installed:

[pandas
numpy
sklearn
seaborn
matplotlib
kneed]

3.Open the Jupyter Notebook (kmeans_tutorial.ipynb), run the cells, and explore the results.

4.Check the tutorial.pdf for detailed explanations.

Dataset: The "Mall Customers" dataset, which has the following columns, is the dataset that was utilized for clustering.
Gender (converted to numerical values)
Age
Annual Income (k$)
Spending Score (1-100)

Remarks:

The notebook shows how to use both Euclidean distance and Cosine similarity with K-means clustering.

To assess the quality of the clustering,Â silhouette score is calculated.

High-dimensional data is visualized in two dimensions using PCA-assisted dimensionality reduction.
